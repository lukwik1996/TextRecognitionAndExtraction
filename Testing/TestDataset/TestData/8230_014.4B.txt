Sherwood
Forest
shrinking
rapidly

Merry men wouldn't
recognize hideout

  NOTTINGHAM, England -~ There isn't
much left of Sherwood Forest, and what
there is, Robin Hood would hardly recog-
nize.
  Farmland, pasture, coal mines and ur-
ban sprawl have claimed most of the
trees. Where there is greenwood, it con-
sists mostly of dense stands of Mediterra-
nean pine, imported and planted by the
government after World War I as  a timber
cash crop.
  But while Sherwood Forest is only a thin
wisp of its medieval past, its scattered
remnants are at the heart of national de-
bate over the future of Britain's public
forest lands.
  Prime Minister John Major's Conserva-
tive government is contemplating whether
to turn over to private investors control of
4,355 square miles of woodland and heath,
nearly 5 percent of the nation's land area.
The land is now managed by the Forestry
Commission, Britain's largest landowner.
  Proponents of free-market economics in
the Tory government argue that privatiza-
tion of Britain's forests, like the earlier
privatization of airlines and utilities,
would draw fresh investment and help re-
new the moribund timber industry.
