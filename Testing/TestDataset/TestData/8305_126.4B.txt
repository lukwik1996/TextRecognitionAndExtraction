gal with inadequate French and nothing to
do, because the university is shut down.
This may be just as well for the students,
because this volunteer has no training or
experience in teaching, and her notion of
suitable material for a Senegalese English
class is the work of William Faulkner.
Her rootless situation bewilders Darren,
who resorts to gin and local lovers and
general blundering about in an alien soci-
ety. Some of the action is funny and some
is brutal, the African background and
characters are always interesting, and the
writing is always adroit. One may, how-
ever, eventually become a bit weary of a
heroine totally devoid of common sense.
