  I followed Rajinder into the bedroom, and the terror was
gone, an open door now shut, and again I felt nothing, as if I 
were marble inside. The two rooms were exactly alike, ex-
cept the bedroom was empty. "And there, the bed," Rajinder
said, placing it with a slight wave of his hand against the 
wall across from the window. He spoke slowly and firmly, as 
if he were describing what was already there. "The fridge 
we can put right there," at the foot of the bed. Both were part
of my dowry. Whenever he looked at me, I either said yes or 
nodded my head in agreement. We went outside and he
showed me the kitchen and the bathroom, which were con-
nected to the flat but could be entered only through doors
opening onto the roof.
  From the roof, a little after eleven, I watched Rajinder
drive away on his scooter. He was going to my parents' flat
in the Old Vegetable Market, where my dowry and our wed-
ding gifts were stored. I had nothing to do while he was 
gone, so I wandered in and out of the flat and around the 
roof. Defense Colony was composed of rows of pale two- or
three-story buildings. A small park, edged with eucalyptus
trees, was behind our house.
  Rajinder returned two hours later with his elder brother,
Ashok, and a yellow van. It took three trips to bring the TV,
the sofa, the fridge, the mixer, the steel plates, and my clothes.
 Each time they left, I wanted them never to return. Whenever
they pulled up outside, Ashok pressed the horn, which played 
"Jingle Bells." I was frightened by Ashok, because, with his
handlebar moustache and muscular forearms, he reminded me
of my father's brothers, who, my mother claimed, beat their 
wives. Listening to his curses drift out of the stairwell each
time he bumped against a wall while maneuvering the sofa,
TV, and fridge up the stairs, I felt ashamed, as if he were curs-
ing the dowry and, through it, me.
  On the first trip they brought back two suitcases that my
mother had packed with my clothes. I was cold, and when 
they left, I changed in the bedroom. My hands were trem-
bling by then, and each time I swallowed, I felt a sharp pain
in my throat that made my eyes water. Standing there in the 
room gray with dust, the light like cold, clear water, I felt sad
and lonely and excited at being naked in an empty room in a 
place where no one knew me. I put on a sylvar kamij, but
even completely covered by the big shirt and pants, I was
cold. I added a sweater and socks, but the cold had slipped
under my skin and lingered beneath my fingernails.
  Rajinder did not appear to notice I had changed. I swept
the rooms while the men were gone, and stacked the 
kitchen shelves with the steel plates, saucers, and spoons
that had come as gifts. Rajinder and Ashok brought all the 
gifts except the bed, which was too big for them. It was 
raised to the roof by pulleys the next day. They were able
to bring up the mattress, though, and the sight of it made 
me happy, for I knew I would fall asleep easily and that an-
other eight hours would pass. 
  We did not eat lunch, but in the evening I made rotis and
