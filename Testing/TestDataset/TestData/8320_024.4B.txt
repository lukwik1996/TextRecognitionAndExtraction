gear, help the crew, or listen to the
weather radio. Don't go below and lie
down, especially if you don't feel well.
This is the worst place to be when 
you're seasick. Stay topside, and re-
main active.


  If you choose to use medica-
tion, start taking it several hours
to a full day before you go to sea.
The most popular non-prescrip-
tion drugs used to combat motion
sickness are dimenhydrinate
(Dramamine), meclizine (Bonine,
Antivert), and diphenhydramine
(Benadryl). The most common
side effect is drowsiness, and most
of these medications are accom-
panied by warnings imploring you
not to drive, operate machinery,
or engage in any hazardous activi-
ty. And as any fisherman will tell
you, "driving hazardous machin-
ery" is a perfect description of 
small boat offshore operation.
Taking half the recommended 
dosage often alleviates seasickness
symptoms without making you 
clumsy and tired.
  Your doctor may prescribe 
Scopolamine in the form of a
skin patch sold as Transderm


ScopTM. The patch is placed behind 
the ear several hours before you go to
sea and the medication is absorbed 
through the skin. This is a very effec-
tive way to reduce the symptoms of
seasickness, but it can cause some un-
pleasant side effects, such as visual dis-
turbances, drowsiness, and confusion.
Scopolamine should be used only after 
discussion with your medical practi-
tioner. Often, using only half a patch
will provide significant relief without
noticeable side effects.
  One drug combination that is par-
ticularly successful at offsetting sea-
sickness is promethazine (Phenergan)
