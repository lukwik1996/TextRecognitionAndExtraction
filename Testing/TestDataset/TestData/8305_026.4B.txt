group, who are exhibiting what psychia-
trists call the syndrome proper, are the 
more perplexing of the two types. Most
believe for an average of five to seven 
days that they are some form of divinity;
then they step back into the milder reli-
gious atmosphere of America or Europe 
as if nothing had happened. Of these,
most are surprisingly responsive to thera-
py. Witztum described one such patient
who spoke of the experience as being 
rather like intoxication. In the summer of 
1986 he entered the Holy Sepulchre and
was overcome by the feeling that he was 
Jesus. When he began sharing this con-
viction aloud with his tour group, he was 
taken to Kfar Shaul psychiatric hospital, 
where he was treated by the hospital's di-
rector, Yair Bar El. Within five days he 
was fine. He returned to his homeland, 
got married, and remains baffled about
what happened. He is extraordinarily po-
lite, as are many of the victims of the 
syndrome proper, most of whom don't
rant but simply worry that they might be 
Jesus.
  The former patient would like to return
to Jerusalem for a visit but worries that
the syndrome will strike again-~as if Je-
rusalem were the problem. Witztum con-
curs. "This case was a reaction to a place,
not a true psychosis," he says. In a new
entry on the syndrome in the Encyclopae-
dia Britannica, the question is asked,
"Does Jerusalem's religious atmosphere
actually induce psychiatric disturbance in
the vulnerable visitor?" Though there is 
no definitive answer yet, Witztum be-
lieves that the "unique atmosphere" of 
Jerusalem together with the complexities 
of the human psyche may be more than 
some travelers can manage.
  In order to explain the syndrome, Witz-
tum differentiates between pilgrims and 
tourists. A tourist moves from the center
of his existence, his home, to the periph-
ery, in order to vacation. A pilgrim, how-
ever, moves from the periphery to the 
center of his world. Perhaps the best defi-
nition of "center" in this context was giv-
en by the religious historian Mircea Eli-
ade, who wrote that the center is where
the "axis mundi [the center axis of mean-
ing] penetrates the earthly sphere."
  Once a tiny hilltop fortification, Jerusa-
lem has come to be the axis mundi for
three of the world's major religions, where
heaven descends to touch and bless the 
earth; Witztum calls the city "the umbili-
