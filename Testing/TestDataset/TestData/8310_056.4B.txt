(symmetric multiprocessing), software-
and hardware-implemented RAID, and 
performance monitoring.
  OS/2 is available with support for SMP
and will soon run on the PowerPC. Net-
Ware support for SMP is expected to 
ship this summer. And the full gamut of 
high-end OS features-~including 32-bit-
ness, multitasking, SMP support, and 
management tools-~has been available 
for years in SCO Unix, Novell's UnixWare,
and Solaris for x86 and Interactive Unix
from SunSoft.
  Though NetWare's performance ben-
efits from kernel-mode operation, its re-
liability suffers: The NOS is subject to
crashing from conflicting NLMs (NetWare
loadable modules). Fortunately, this isn't
the problem it would be in a general-pur-
pose OS, because end users typically
don't load software onto servers. But
NetWare must evolve task isolation and 
preemptive multitasking to become a 
credible application server, which is pre-
cisely what Novell plans to do in Super-
NOS, a next-generation OS combining 
NetWare and UnixWare.
