  YOKOHAMA, Japan -~ When
Morihiro Hosokawa took office as
prime minister last year, promising
to lower taxes and prices to make
life better for Japan's silent majority
of urban consumers, he raised
hopes in the Hibari housing com-
plex, where 500 middle-class fam-
ilies live in small apartments in 21
identical concrete buildings.

  Now, Hosokawa's sudden deci-
sion to resign is being viewed in Hi-
bari with disillusionment.
 
  Despite his fresh appearance and
flashy style, the people say, Ho-
sokawa accomplished little to make
their lives easier. And despite vow-
ing to clean up politics, he had to
resign because of questions over his
financial dealings.
 
  "People had high hopes for Mr.
Hosokawa, but they were be-
trayed," said Fumiko Ando, who
works in a flower shop just outside
the apartment complex. As a result,
she said, "people's expectations to-
ward politicians are rather thin."

  Taeko Hashimoto, 42, an exercise
instructor, said: "I was hoping poli-
tics would make the lives of ordi-
nary people easier. But even before
Mr. Hosokawa resigned, I realized it
was a difficult task. We work and
work, but our lives never improve."

  That sense of frustration was ech-
oed by people from various walks of
life elsewhere in Japan.

  "We were expecting that Ho-
sokawa could achieve the reform of
Japanese politics," said Dr. Michio
Naito, 73, a physician in Fujiyoshida
City, at the base of Mount Fuji. "But
although our expectations were
high, we found that he also is just
like an old-fashioned politician."

  Given their low faith in politics,
people seemed to care little about
