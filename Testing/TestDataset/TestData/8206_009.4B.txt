  SEATTLE - By a window in Kurt
Cobain's rural getaway cottage near
Carnation, Wash., lay a black-ink
drawing of the sun accompanied by
the reminder "Cheer Up."
  Most wealthy and popular 27-
year-olds might not have needed
that message.
  Cobain was different. The rock
star's last weeks were marked by
his uneven resistance to frantic res-
cue attempts by those around him.
  "He was at war with himself,"
said Danny Goldberg, president of
Atlantic Records and one of Co-
bain's confidants. "There was a side


who wanted to die, there
was a side who wanted to
live."
  Cobain's body was
found April 8. He appar-
ently killed himself three
days earlier.
  A campaign to get Nir-
vana's lead singer into a
treatment program for
drugs and depression be-
gan after a March 18 inci-
dent in which his wife,
singer Courtney Love, told
police he was suicidal.
  A group of record exec-
utives and friends joined


Love in efforts to get Cobain off his
self-destructive path, confronting
him with the enormity of his prob-
lems in a process known as "inter-
vention."
  Cobain wasn't immediately recep-
tive, but two days later he relented
and checked into a hospital in Mari-
na Del Rey, Calif. He stayed only
two days.
  Cobain's pain was obvious to
those around him.
  His physical agony was the legacy
of chronic bronchitis, a sleeping ail-
ment called narcolepsy, curvature
of the spine known as scoliosis and
severe gastric problems.
